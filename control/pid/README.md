### Control

Control will be achieved by setting targets for angular velocity, acceleration and jerk (3rd derivative) and utalising a PID circuit to modify the motors duty cycle to compensate for dynamic and systematic drag, maintaining a precise angular velocity and achieving that speed with grace.
